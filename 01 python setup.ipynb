    "I recently completed an introductary guide to R programming aimed at teaching the basic tools necessary to use R for data analysis and preditive modeling. R is a great language for statistics and data analysis because the language was built with that goal in mind. Python is only language to rival R's popularity for data analysis. Unlike R, Python is a general-purpose language that isn't designed for any particular task. It is a jack-of-all-trades with a vibrant ecosystem of data science software libraraies that extend its base functionality, making it a data analysis and preditive modeling powerhouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide does not assume prior programming experience and focuses on using Python as a tool for data analysis. Since Python is a general purpose language, however, it will take several lessons to build the basic Python proficiency necessary to start getting into data analysis. If you already have basic Python proficiency, you may want to skip ahead. After Part 1, this guide will not spend much time comparing Python and R, as it does not assume R knowledge. In my experience, it is easier to learn how to program in Python, but it is easier to get started with data analysis in R because all the tools you need are either baked in or one simple download away. If you're just getting into data science for the first time, you can't go wrong with either language and it is a good idea to learn both eventaully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the biggest downside of Python as a language is that it has two major branches, Python 2.7 and Python 3.X, which are not fully compatible with one another. This means code written for 2.7 generally does't work in Python 3 and vise versa, so certain software libraries might only be available for one or the ohter. As a result, managing add-on libraries and thier dependencies in Python can be troublesome. The differences bewteen Python 2.7 and 3.X won't really affect our learning of the language itself, however, as the basic syntax is mostly the same bewteen both version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will use Python version 3.4. All code presented should work with version of Python 3.4 or later. Most if not all of the the code will also work on Python 2.7, so you can still follow along if you are using Python 2.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Python package management can be difficult, I do not recommend installing Python and its data analysis libraries individually. It is easiest to download the Anaconda Python distribution from Continuum Analytics. Anaconda bundles Python with dozens of popular data anlaysis libraries and it comes with a nice integrated development environment (a fancy code editor) called Spyder. Simply go to the Continuum Analytics download page, click the download link appropriate for your operating system and Python version and then run the installer to set up the Anaconda Python environment."
