# Python_For_Data_Analysis

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks used to create my 30 part introduction to Python for data analysis published on my blog.
The index for the guide can be found here: http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/12/python-for-data-analysis-index.html 

The notebooks in this repo are not fully edited for spelling, grammar etc.
